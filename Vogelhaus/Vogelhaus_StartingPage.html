    <h1>Hit the Birdiess!</h1>
    <p>Start the game. Throw snowballs at birds and hit them (left mouse click). Increase your score.
        <br> You'll lose a point if you miss the bird. You have 20 snowballs you can throw.
        <br> Feed them to attract them (right/middle mouse click), so it's easier to hit the birds. You only have 3 throws of food. 
        <br> You can look at the Highscore before and after the game.</p>
